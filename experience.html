            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>Here follows my experience in terms of importance to me: <br> I am a father of 3 children.  I have traveled to 35+ countries, some with 3 small kids (I lost count at 30). 
            I have jumped out of a helicopter at 10000'.  I've trekked on horseback through Outer Mongolia.  I've travelled overland from Kenya to Tanzania.  I've visited the first parliament in history in Iceland. I've freedived with a Minke whale.
        I've jumped into crocodile infested waters in North Queensland.  And then there's the stuff that I wont print...</p>
            <p>Before this year, I had absolutely no experience in coding.  With the help of this course that's all about to change.</p>
            <h2>Recordable Experience</h2>
            <ul class="hist">
                <li>2006 - Bachelor's Degree in Criminology (Chinese major)</li>
                <li>Open water scuba certificate</li>
                <li>2012 - Advanced Diploma in Investigations</li>
                <li>2016 - Detective, Queensland Police</li>
                <li>2018 - SSI Freediver</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Aside from the travelling, the kids, the serious stuff, here is some stuff I consider pretty cool:
            <ul class="hist">
                <li>I once chased down a "bad guy" on foot through streets and backyards and, after catching him
                (with a stolen phone), solved a 10 year old armed robbery within 4 hours.</li>
                <li>I've stayed with a Mongolian family in a Gyr on the Steppes. </li>
                <li>I've ridden a motorbike from Hanoi to Sapa in Vietnam (crashing into a dog halfway and falling off).</li>
                <li> And I've created this webpage.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
