            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I was born and raised in Ipswich, Australia.  I grew up in a sporting household playing basketball, tennis and cricket.  After finishing high school I eventually joined the Queensland Police and performed first reponse duties in South Brisbane and North Queensland. </p>
            <p>In 2010 I got married and from December 2010 to December 2011 as a honeymoon, my wife and I backpacked
                around the world. We returned to North Queensland and our previous occupations and almost immediately I
                obtained a job as an investigator in the Criminal Investigation Branch, South Brisbane. From 2012 on I worked towards making Detective which I achieved in January 2016 and soon found myself partnered with
                junior investigators and coordinating major investigations.</p>
            <p> In this time, my wife had our 3 children and it is for them, that I quit my job now find myself travelling the world.  </p>
            <h3>What matters to me now:</h3>
            <ul class="hist">
                <li>My family</li>
                <li>Living Life</li>
                <li>Seeing it All</li>
            </ul>
            <p>One more thing...<br> I have a desire to learn, to work and to help others which is why I've chosen this course.</p>
